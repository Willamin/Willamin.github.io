# Crimson on Sage Green

As I sit and wait with you,
A story I shall tell.
Except between the two of us
It will not be unveiled.

On this dark and rainy night,
I started up your hill,
To the tattered broken house
So I could take my kill.

As I circled 'round the house
Looking to intrude,
I came upon a loose window
And then my plans ensued.

Ambled I and took a look
To pick out your last scene.
You would stain the carpet floor
With crimson on sage green.

Here you came! I went upstairs
to the room where you sleep.
I crept and sat in the corner:
A wolf waiting for sheep.

As you slowly scaled the stairs
I'm shaking from the thrill.
I've dreamed of this for oh so long
Now I can fin'lly kill.

So you sat upon the bed
I crept up from behind.
You turned, saw me, and ran away,
Your scream unconfined.

As I chased you to the stairs,
You started to descend.
Halfway down you slipped and fell;
You broke your back, my friend.

I dragged you to the bathroom tub-
'Tis there that you were lain.
I opened up the water pipes
And then closed off the drain.

Here I sit, I watch, I wait,
And finish up my tale,
As you try to fight for life,
But it's of no avail.
