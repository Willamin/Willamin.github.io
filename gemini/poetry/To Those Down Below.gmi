# To Those Down Below

To those down below
Rarely seen, rarely felt
quietly moving about
blending with the colours of earth
Almost invisible.
But I see you!
O' yes, I see you!
scurrying about
traversing great plains,
cellulosic cylinders so wide,
And even myself at times.
Clamoring over
trying to just
simply get a bit of food.
Those down below.
